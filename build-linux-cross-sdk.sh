# Cross-Compilation SDK: $SDK_NAME

This is an old-style Swift cross-compilation SDK that provides the needed sysroot and Swift libraries
to compile for the given distribution and architecture. These SDKs require that they be installed at
an absolute path for them to work. This SDK is built to be installed at /opt like this:

 - /opt/$SDK_NAME

If you desire to install it to a different location, simply edit the $DISTRIBUTION.json or 
$DISTRIBUTION-static.json file in this directory to change all the "/opt" paths to your new location.

The SDK also assumes that your host Swift toolchain is installed at /usr/bin, but this can also be
changed in the $DISTRIBUTION.json/$DISTRIBUTION-static.json files. PLEASE NOTE: You *MUST* use the
exact same version of the host Swift toolchain ($SWIFT_TAG) for this SDK to work. If you have a
version mismatch you will be unable to cross-compile using this SDK. You have been warned!

To use the SDK, simply provide the "--destination" param on the command line when building a Swift
app:

> swift build --destination /opt/$SDK_NAME/$DISTRIBUTION.json

Or, to compile a binary with the static Swift stdlib included, use the $DISTRIBUTION-static.json
file instead, like this:

> swift build --destination /opt/$SDK_NAME/$DISTRIBUTION-static.json --static-swift-stdlib

Of course, if you have installed the SDK to a different path, use that path instead.
